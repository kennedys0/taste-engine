# Style pack: Retro Terminal

**ID:** `retro-terminal`  
**Signature:** Authentic CRT developer-console visual language, phosphor glow, monospace tabular structure, and modern keyboard-driven utility.

> This is a **style pack, not a mandatory default**. Load it only after explicit selection or confirmed applicable project style. Project instructions can override individual choices. Preserve accessibility, utility, and brand constraints. Fonts are suggestions, not required dependencies. A plain black page with unstyled green text **does not qualify as Retro Terminal**.

## Good fit / trade-offs

- **Works well for:** Developer portfolios, CLI cloud dashboards, cybersecurity and devops tools, system monitoring consoles, and creative coding experiences.
- **Be careful with:** Non-technical consumer audiences who may find strict monospace data layouts or terminal metaphors unfamiliar.
- **Reference directions:**
  - *Classic Amber CRT:* Obsidian black background (`#0C0D0E`) with warm phosphor amber (`#FFB000`), subtle raster scanlines, and high-contrast cream labels.
  - *Phosphor Matrix Green:* Deep graphite canvas (`#0A0F0D`) with electric phosphor green (`#33FF33`), bracketed window titles, and crisp log streams.
  - *Cyberdeck Cyan:* High-tech terminal with luminous cyan (`#00F0FF`), crisp box-drawing borders (`┌─┐`), and keyboard shortcut tags (`[ESC]`).

## Retro terminal fidelity gate — mandatory

**Before calling a retro-terminal page complete, the opening viewport must visibly read as a real, working terminal console or command deck.** If a user chose this style, an ordinary dark website with monospace font is a **FAIL**, even if CSS classes contain `terminal`.

A successful retro-terminal implementation demonstrates **all** of the following:

1. **Phosphor Glow & High-Contrast Luminance:** Text and active indicators exhibit subtle phosphor radiation (`text-shadow: 0 0 6px currentColor`), with primary output passing WCAG AA contrast against obsidian grounds.
2. **Subtle CRT Raster Scanline Overlay:** Surfaces feature a controlled, static horizontal scanline pattern (`repeating-linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(0,0,0,0.15) 0px, transparent 2px)`) that adds genuine display depth without impairing character legibility.
3. **Structured ASCII / Bracketed Layout Framing:** Window headers, panel frames, and status bars use crisp 1px rules, ASCII box characters (`┌─┐`), or bracketed badges (`[SYS_OK]`, `[MODE: CLI]`).
4. **Authentic Command Prompt & Caret:** Interfaces feature an active shell prompt line (`visitor@terminal:~$`) with a solid block caret (`█`) and distinct command history styling.
5. **Monospace Tabular Alignment:** Content aligns strictly along monospace character columns for timestamps, status codes, process IDs, and data readouts.

**First-viewport test:** In a desktop screenshot, identify the terminal prompt, phosphor glow, scanline raster, and bracketed console frames **without reading the page title**. If it looks like a generic dark blog, add the scanline overlay and terminal prompt structure.

## Explicit retro-terminal scanline exception — phosphor glow is allowed

**Retro-terminal-specific override:** The universal anti-slop caution against *decorative overlays or screen textures* MUST NOT be interpreted as a ban on subtle scanlines, phosphor glow, or shell prompt lines here. These are **material-enabling properties**, essential to the CRT console aesthetic.

- **Allowed material treatments:** Monospace box-drawing borders, phosphor text glow (`0 0 6px`), static scanline raster overlays, bracketed status pills, and blinking/solid block carets.
- **Anti-slop boundary:** Every command line or action must be usable. Do not flood screens with unreadable falling matrix characters, fake terminal boot errors, or static decorative code snippets masquerading as a functional UI.
- **Anti-slop interpretation:** Evaluate terminal elements by **command clarity, legibility, and developer productivity**, not by banning monospace frames. Removing scanlines and prompt lines to satisfy a generic flat heuristic is a **design regression**.

## Typography and typewriting

High-legibility monospace: JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, Fira Code, or system monospace (`ui-monospace, monospace`). Primary body: 14–15 px; headings: 20–32 px with bold weight (700) and uppercase bracketed styling (`### [SYSTEM_OVERVIEW]`). Maintain strict character grid alignment.

## Color direction

- **Canvas Base:** Obsidian black (`#0C0D0E` or `#080A08`).
- **Surface Panels:** Deep slate-charcoal (`#14171A` or `#111613`).
- **Phosphor Accent (Choose One):**
  - Classic Amber: `#FFB000` (glow: `rgba(255, 176, 0, 0.45)`)
  - Phosphor Green: `#33FF33` (glow: `rgba(51, 255, 51, 0.45)`)
  - Cyber Cyan: `#00F0FF` (glow: `rgba(0, 240, 255, 0.45)`)
- **Semantic Statuses:** Error Red (`#FF5555`), Warning Yellow (`#FFCC00`), Success Mint (`#50FA7B`).

## Layout and geometry

Corners are sharp or minimal (`0px–4px`); 1px solid terminal panel borders; tight vertical rhythm (4px/8px monospace line grid). Panels model modular terminal multiplexers (tmux/screen style).

## Surfaces, depth, texture

- **Terminal Screen:** Deep black background with static scanline raster overlay.
- **Console Panel:** 1px solid border (`1px solid rgba(255, 176, 0, 0.3)` or `#2A2F35`) with subtle inset shadow.
- **Active Cursor:** Block caret with 1s pulse or solid active state.

## Component anatomy and interaction

- **Command Line Prompt:** `user@system:~$ command --flag` with functional input and clear return results.
- **Terminal Button / Action:** Outlined bracket button (`[ EXECUTE ]` or `[ CANCEL ]`) with hover color inversion (`background: currentColor; color: #000;`).
- **Data Log Stream:** Tabular rows with timestamp, log level tag, and message.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Bracketed key indicators (`[⌘+K]`, `[ENTER]`) with clear pointer click fallbacks.

## Motion

Immediate state changes by default (0–80 ms). Optional skippable character typing effect for hero intros only. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` immediately.

## Optional Anime.js v4 recipe

- **Motion decision:** Monospace character typing reveal or terminal scan bar sweep; keep frame rate stable.
- **Starting duration:** 100ms per token block (0 = immediate); adjust to task and user preference.
- **Avoid:** screen jitter, artificial distortion waves, perpetual flickering loops.
- **Dependency:** CSS/native by default. Use Anime.js v4 only if the requested interaction justifies it. Follow Taste Engine `references/motion-engine.md` when available; standalone skill follows the reduced-motion and no-decorative-loop principles above.

## UI writing and microcopy

Precise, technical, and command-driven. Examples: `deploy --prod`, `status: healthy`, `4 processes running`. Avoid patronizing marketing chatter.

## Starter tokens (suggestions, not a complete theme)

| Token | Starting value |
| --- | --- |
| `--taste-term-bg` | `#0c0d0e` |
| `--taste-term-surface` | `#14171a` |
| `--taste-term-amber` | `#ffb000` |
| `--taste-term-glow` | `0 0 6px rgba(255, 176, 0, 0.45)` |
| `--taste-term-border` | `1px solid rgba(255, 176, 0, 0.25)` |
| `--taste-term-scanline` | `repeating-linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(0,0,0,0.18) 0px, transparent 2px)` |
| `--taste-term-radius` | `2px` |
| `--taste-term-font-mono` | `JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, monospace` |
| `--taste-term-motion-duration` | `80ms` |

Tokens represent a **direction** and are not copy-paste guaranteed for every palette/platform. Define `--taste-term-*` at project level, ensure color contrast, and adapt via theme tokens rather than scattering literal values.

## Hero composition (full first viewport)

**When a public-facing portfolio/landing/homepage has a hero:** use a one-visible-screen header+hero composition. Base height on `min-height: 100svh` with `100vh` fallback, subtracting the **real** header only when it is in normal flow; let the hero expand for accessibility and short mobile screens. Do not apply this to private dashboards or other task screens; direct user overrides win. **Style-specific direction:** Construct the first viewport as an authentic interactive console session with welcome ASCII banner, system status summary, and a working prompt line. Do not simulate fake matrix rain or unreadable glitch loops. See the router `references/hero-layout.md` when present. Standalone use follows the same responsive and anti-slop principles.


## Style-specific quality gate

- **Do:** Verify high text contrast against obsidian grounds (WCAG AA); ensure monospace alignment is preserved; provide click fallbacks for all keyboard shortcuts; test scanline readability.
- **Don't:** Do not treat a plain dark theme as retro-terminal; avoid illegible glitch animations; do not present fake non-interactive console prompts that confuse users.
- Confirm desktop and mobile consistency; visible keyboard focus (`:focus-visible`); loading, empty, disabled, error and success states; reduced-motion behavior (`prefers-reduced-motion`).
- Do not inject style-specific assumptions into unrelated projects. When combining styles, explicitly name the primary style and the borrowed features.
## Anti-slop: style-specific

**Developer utility, not Hollywood hacker theater.**

- **Reject:** Fake matrix rain, flashing strobe lights, illegible CRT distortion, unprompted audio beeps, and dummy code blocks with no relation to user tasks.
- **Instead:** Build an authentic, highly functional CLI-inspired interface with clean monospace hierarchy, keyboard shortcuts, and structured command feedback.
- **Copy check:** Use real system terminology and direct commands; avoid movie hacker slang.
- **Audit:** Run universal anti-slop purpose, truth, nested-surface, copywriting, responsiveness, accessibility and motion checks **in addition** to this style's quality gate. Do not penalize deliberate, accessible features characteristic of `retro-terminal`.
